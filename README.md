# LuckyShrubWebApplication
Pure HTML and CSS web application design for Lucky Shrub Garden Design Firm. 
Using pure HTML and CSS for front-end web development is a good approach when a particular platform does not support the CSS framework (eg. bootstrap) being used.

This web application is only focused on front-end design by using HTML and CSS. All the effects, animation, and responsive pages were written by using only CSS. 

This web application includes 5 pages. They are:
(1) index.html - which is the landing page/home page of the web application, it has 3 sections such as 'Nav bar', 'promotion area', 'catalog, and services' provided by the company. 
(2) catalog.html - which is the catalog page that displays plant type and this page can be accessed from either the 'Nav bar' or a brief explanation of the 'Discover Plants Here' button from the 'Home' page.
(3) project.html - which is the project reference page that displays projects that have been completed by Luch Shrub Garden Design Firm. This page can be accessed from either the 'Nav bar' or a brief explanation of the 'Discover Our Projects Here'button from the 'Home' page.
(4) book.html - which is the booking page to book with the architect and this page can be accessed from either the 'Nav bar' or the 'Book Now' button  from the 'Home' page.
(5) about.html - which is the about page of the application.

# How to run the application  
In VS code, please open 'index.html' right click 'Open In Default Browser', then you can see the landing page on your browser, you can click on the Nav bar or the button on the 'Home' page to see the design and content from it.
